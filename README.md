# Awesome PS1 prompt ideas

These were originally done with Firacode Nerdfont, if they don't display correctly,
consider swithching to that font. In theory, they should work with every Nerdfont.

## Rules:
	- Absolutely anything can go in the prompts. This includes:
		- emojis
		- weird symbols
		- ascii or unicode art
		- can generate prompts with code (as you will see)
	- be creative
	- PLEASE name your propmts. I want to be able to search for them later.
	- NSFW prompts welcome (if you have any)
